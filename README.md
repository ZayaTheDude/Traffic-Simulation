# Traffic Simulation (Pygame)

This is a minimal Pygame simulation scaffold. You can add your simulation logic in `main.py`.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the simulation:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Deployment

This project is structured to be easily deployed to a cloud environment that supports Python and Pygame.

---

- `main.py`: Entry point for the simulation (currently opens a blank Pygame window).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
